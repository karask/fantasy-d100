\chapter{Combat}
\label{ch:combat}

Fantasy D100 is a swords and sorcery game and, as such, swords will be drawn during epic quests with the aim of spilling blood. Be it for glory, honour, fame or riches, when all else fails violence is the means of achieving these goals. The characters come from worlds that are rife with conflict, where warriors are required to wage wars against evil neighbours, wandering bandits and foul monsters that come out of the wilderness.  

It should be remembered that Fantasy D100 is not a game purely about combat, just as it is not purely about magic. It would not be unusual for whole sessions to pass without any physical violence. However, in time, characters will get involved in dangerous life threatening fights. 

This chapter provides you with a straightforward and direct system for playing out action packed and deadly combat.

\section{Combat is Tough}
Characters that have weapon skills less than 100\% are at the whim of the dice to determine whether or not they land a blow in combat. Anything you do to increase your character’s chances to hit, or hit first, will stand in your favour and make the outcome more certain.

Once you are hit in combat, things start getting messy. Your character has a relatively low number of hit points. In a couple of blows, or one lucky blow, these hit points can easily be reduced to zero, which indicates that the character has died. Make sure your character can dodge, parry or has magical protection. With Major Wounds your character is especially at risk of grievous and permanent harm every time they decide to use violence to solve a problem.

Numbers count. If you are facing off against multiple opponents, even weak and unskilled ones, you are quickly going to run out of attacks and reactions. In practical terms this means that your character may, at best, reduce the number of attackers by one per round, while only being able to protect themselves against one of several incoming attacks. 

Even Masters are vulnerable. A weapon skill over 100\% is no guarantee of survival, as characters can be brought low by a lucky critical hit, or by an opponent who has lured them into an ambush and stacked the odds against them through surprise and careful planning. 

These harsh realities mean that players tend to avoid combats where they do not have a very good chance to win.  Instead of wading into masses of weaker opponents, hoping that lucky dice rolls will see them through, they carefully plan ambushes, where they have the benefit of terrain and supporting soldiers from the local militia that will allow them to wipe out the majority of the enemy before the first proper round of combat. They will any of their talents to boost their damage, chances to hit, or armour and in general try to get an advantage.


\section{Summary of Combat}
\begin{description}
	\item[Work out encounter distance:] The Games Master determines how far away the hostile group is to the player characters, either at Range or Close.

	\item[Drop into Combat time:] Combat is divided into rounds. A single round has a duration of five seconds of time, giving 12 rounds in every minute. During a round every character can perform one action. Combat rounds cycle through the following steps:
	\begin{rpg-list}
	\item Determine Order: At the start of every combat, check each character’s Combat Order,  calculated as $(DEX+INT)/2 + 1D6$. Combat Order is in the character sheet; only the dice needs to be rolled to determine final Combat Order.
	\item Characters Take Action \& Reaction: In a combat round each character gets one Combat Action and one Defensive Reaction. Combat Actions, such as attacks, take place in Combat Order. The character with the highest order will act first, followed by the character with the second-highest order, and so on until the character with the lowest order acts. Reactions, such as parries or dodges, are made during this process as they are needed.
	\item End of Combat Round: Once all eligible characters have acted in the combat round, it is over. If there are characters still engaged in combat with enemies, another combat round begins. 
	\end{rpg-list}
\end{description}

\begin{rpg-examplebox}
For example: Lura has a Combat Order of 15 (13 Dex + 17 Int) and rolled a 3 thus having a final of 18. A Goblin has 13 Combat Order (14 Dex + 11 Int) and rolled a 4 for a total of 17. Thus the Combat Order is Lura acting before the Goblin.
\end{rpg-examplebox}

\section{Encounter Distance}
Not all combats start with the two sides, the players and their opponents, directly facing each other within swords reach.  At the beginning of a combat, or potential combat, the Games Master must determine which of the two distances the encounter starts at.

Close is a range of two metres or less and is the distance at which a character can engage in either Close or Unarmed combat. 

Ranged, beyond two metres up to double the range of the missile weapon a character is holding, is the distance at which the character can engage in ranged combat.  Ranged combat typically happens out in the open countryside where groups of combatants can see each over coming over the horizon or emerging in the distance from old ruined buildings.


\subsection{Some Basic Rules}
\begin{rpg-list}
\item A Combat Round lasts five seconds.

\item You get one Combat Action, usually an attack, and one Defensive Reaction, usually a defensive action, per combat round.

\item You can move your Movement Rate in a Combat Round without losing your Action or Reaction. 

\item You can run twice your Movement Rate in a Combat Round but you may only Dodge as your Reaction.

\item To defend or attack you roll against your Close Combat, Ranged Combat or Unarmed Combat skill depending on the type of weapon you are using.

\item When attacked you can either Parry (use the Close Combat or Unarmed skill) or Dodge as a Reaction.

\item If your character successfully Dodges an attack they take no damage.

\item If your opponent successfully Parries your attack their weapon or shield reduces the damage your attack does.

\item If you successfully hit your opponent takes damage to their hit points equal to 
	Weapon Damage rolled + your Damage Modifier - (Opponent’s Armour Points)
\end{rpg-list}


\section{Combat Actions}
The actions a character may take when it is his turn to act are detailed here. A character can only choose one of the options below each round.

\subsection{Close Combat Actions}
\begin{description}
	\item[Charge:]  If a character can move a minimum of five metres towards his opponent, then he can make a charge. He may move a distance up to - but no more than - twice his Movement Rate.  This must be in a straight line and he must end up adjacent to an enemy.  When the move is complete, a close combat attack may be made against the enemy. If the attack is successful, the character gains a bonus of +1D6 damage. He loses his defensive reaction for the round that he charges on. Characters may not charge uphill and gain the damage bonus.
	\item[Close Combat Attack:]  The character can make a single close combat attack. As well as a normal attack, there are the following special attacks.
		\begin{rpg-list}
		\item All out Attack: The attacker gives up their Reaction for the round but gains a second attack, which happens straight after the first attack. Both attacks are at -20\% due to the loss of skill during this frenzied attack. This type of attack cannot be combined with Great Attack or Disarming Attack.

\item Disarming Attack:  Attacker attacks at -20\% to his weapon skill with the aim of disarming their opponent either of their weapon or shield. If the attack is successful and the opponent fails to parry or dodge, the weapon or shield is thrown 1D6 metres away from the owner. 

\item Great Attack: This attack is made using swords, axes or maces where the attacker has enough room to wind up the weapon for a really forceful blow. The attacker gains a +20\% to attack and automatically does the maximum damage bonus value but loses his reaction for that combat round.
		\end{rpg-list}
	\item[Intimidate/Persuade:]  The character tries to get the other side to surrender or flee. This can either be targeted at a single enemy or a group.  Do an Opposed roll using the character’s Influence vs. the enemies’ Persistence, modified as listed below. Groups roll once using the Persistence of the group leader. If the group leader’s Influence skill is higher than his Persistence, then they may use that skill instead. Apply the following modifiers to the enemy’s skill depending on the state of the enemy.
	\begin{rpg-table}[|c|X|]
		\hline
		+40\% & if the enemy is still at full strength, or has only taken some minor wounds.\\
		+20\% & if the enemy out numbers the player’s side, but have had at least 20\% losses either in numbers or hit points.\\
		-20\% & if the enemy is fewer than the player’s side and has taken some wounds.\\
		-40\% & if the enemy has taken more than half hit points in wounds and/or has seen half his group incapacitated by the players.\\
		\hline
		\multicolumn{2}{|p{\linewidth-4.5mm}|}{Note: these modifiers are not cumulative. Apply the one that best describes the situation.}\\
		\hline
	\end{rpg-table}

If the enemy is at full strength and/or outnumbers the player characters then only a critical roll for Influence vs a failed Persistence roll will make them surrender.  A fumbled Persistence roll will see the enemy suddenly rout.

When the player is attempting the roll they must declare whether they are targeting the whole group or singling out an individual.  The Games Master has the final say on who is targeted and if if attempt is possible at all. 

	\begin{rpg-examplebox}
Rurik is fighting a group of four goblins, one of whom he has already badly wounded while the other three are still at full hit points. 

If he decides to single out the wounded Goblin, then the Goblin’s Persistence roll to resist Rurik’s taunting and the resultant urge to flee will be at -20\%. If he decides to target the whole group, which as a whole is undamaged and outnumbers him, then the Goblins will be at +20\% to their Persistence. 
	\end{rpg-examplebox}

The character need not speak the same language as the opponent they are trying to Influence, but they must be capable of some sort of sign, gesture or body language that the opponent is capable of understanding.

	\item[Set Weapon:]  A character can spend their Action setting the shaft of a weapon, such as a spear or polearm, in the ground in anticipation of a charge from an opponent. When the charge actually comes the character automatically gets an attack at +20\% before the charging character gets their attack. If the character makes any other action or reaction before the charge, the weapon becomes ‘unset’.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Making Close Combat Attacks}
\begin{rpg-list}
\item Making the Attack: To attack, the player simply rolls 1D100 and compares it to the character’s Close Combat skill which may be modified for the specific situation or special attack being attempted. If a character rolls equal to or lower than his Weapon skill, he has hit his target. If a character rolls greater than his Weapon skill, he has missed his target. 

\item Target Reaction: If the enemy has already reacted this round, or chooses not to React against this attack, then this attack is unopposed. Move straight on to Damage Resolution. If the attack is opposed, the defender makes a Dodge or Parry (see below).

\item Damage Resolution: If the attack is successful, damage is rolled. Each weapon has its own Damage score, to which is added the attacker’s Damage Modifier in order to determine the total damage being dealt. If the defender is armoured then the armour will absorb some of this damage. Reduce the attack’s damage by the armour points (AP) of the defender’s armour. 

\item Damage Application: Apply any remaining damage to the defender’s hit points.

        \hline
\end{rpg-table}
\end{center}
\end{table*}


\subsection{Unarmed Combat Actions}
The following are potential actions:
\begin{description}
\item[Unarmed Combat Attack:] The character can make a single Unarmed Combat Attack.
\item[Natural Weapon attack:] Using the characters’s natural weapons be it claw, bite, kick or fist.
\item[Grapple Attack:] The attacker attempts to grab an opponent and an opposed Unarmed Combat Attack is made. If the attacker wins they may chose to inflict pain, immobilise or throw their opponent.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Making Unarmed Combat Attacks}
Roll against Unarmed Combat skill to determine if the attack is successful. If an Unarmed Attack is parried by a crafted or natural weapon, then the attacker will immediately suffer the rolled damage of the parrying weapon, with no damage modifier. This is in addition to the normal effect of the parry. 

\subsubsection{Natural Weapons}
Natural Weapons such as the teeth and claws of monsters are counted as weapons and not Unarmed Attacks. The damage they deal is listed in the monster’s description. They may parry other Natural Weapons or Unarmed Attacks, but not crafted weapon attacks.

\subsubsection{Grappling}
Grapple Attack is made in the same way as a normal Unarmed or Natural Weapon attack but must be declared as such before any dice are rolled. Should the attacker hit with his grapple attack, no damage is initially caused. Instead, the attacker then opposes his Unarmed Combat Skill to the target’s Unarmed Combat Skill, in a roll similar to an opposed skill test:
\begin{rpg-list}
\item \textbf{Grapple Fails:} The grapple attempt fails and the attack is considered to have missed. 
\item \textbf{Grapple Succeeds:} The two combatants are now grappling and the attacker may immediately follow up on this success by Throwing, Inflicting pain or Immobilise the target.
\end{rpg-list}

\begin{description}
\item[Break Free:] To break out of a grapple, the character makes an opposed Grapple Attack. The characters may only use the Unarmed Combat Skill in this case. If the character succeeds his roll while his opponent fails then the character has succeeded in breaking free and the combatants are no longer grappling, though they will be adjacent.
\item[Immobilise:] While immobilised, enemies are considered helpless. Once per round the defender may attempt to break free.
\item[Inflict Pain:] The grappler inflicts damage of 1D4 + damage modifiers.  Armour does not help. Once per round the defender may attempt to break free or may attempt to turn the tables on their attacker by counter grappling.
\item[Throw:] The opponent is thrown 2 metres and suffers 1D4 damage. Armour does not help. The grapple ends in this case.
\end{description}


\subsection{Ranged Combat Actions}

The following are potential actions:
\begin{description}
\item[Ranged Combat Attack:] The character can make a single ranged combat attack. As well as a normal attack, there is the following special attacks.
\item[Aim:] Every round spent aiming adds a +20\% bonus to the character’s Ranged Combat skill. This bonus only applies to the first attack the character makes with the weapon, which must be fired at the target being aimed at. A character can aim a maximum of 2 rounds and can take no other Reaction while aiming without losing the aim bonus.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Throwing Close Combat Weapons}
If a close combat weapon that isn’t designed to be thrown is hurled at an enemy then it has a range of 8m and suffers a penalty to the attack equal to its ENC x 10. Ranged Combat skill is used. 

\subsubsection{Using Ranged Weapons}
All ranged attacks are handled in same manner as close combat attacks, with the following exceptions: 
\begin{description}
\item[Charge:] Ranged attacks may not be used as part of a charge.
\item[Loading Ranged Weapons:] Most ranged weapons only take a single combat round to ready. Others take more than one combat round to reload. See weapon description in the equipment chapter. 
\item[Range:] A target within the weapon’s range may be attacked without penalty. A target within double the weapon’s range may be attacked, but the attacker’s weapon skill is halved before other modifiers are applied. Attacks cannot be made at a distance beyond twice/double the weapon’s range.
\item[Dodging and Parrying:] The target may attempt to Parry or Dodge a hand thrown ranged attack at -20\% but may not normally Dodge or Parry ranged missile weapons (such as Bows and Crossbow fire). Shield-carrying characters may Parry hand thrown missile weapons with no penalty.
\item[Disarming:] A character may not attempt to disarm targets with ranged attacks, nor may he attempt to strike a target’s weapon or shield.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Cover}
Cover affects both ranged and close combat attacks. For missile attacks the defender benefits from the best of the shield modifier in the table above and the cover modifier below.

\begin{description}
	\item[Partial cover (-20\%):] For example a low wall that leaves only head and torso exposed.
	\item[Very good cover (-40\%):] For example Defender on a castle wall, firing from protected battlements.
	\item[Virtual total cover (-80\%):] For example castle wall with arrow slits for defenders to shot through.
