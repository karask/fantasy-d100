\section{Introduction}
Bllah blah on disciplines... not a lot to say... maybe does not worth a chapter?

\section{Power}

\subsection{Regaining Power Points}
Using Power Points is a draining and exhausting activity that requires a major effort from which the body needs to recover. Power Points regenerate once the character fully rests, either by sitting down and taking it very easy or by having a good nights sleep. 

For every two hour period that a character rests they regain Power Points equal to a quarter of their POW total.  

\begin{rpg-examplebox}
Rurik, with a POW of 8, takes two hours of rest to regain two Power Points, four hours to regain four Power Points, six hours to regain six Power Points and eight hours to regain the full eight Power Points. 
\end{rpg-examplebox}

Basically, if the character has a comfortable uninterrupted sleep of eight hours they will regain their full magic points. Characters may never exceed their original Power Point total by resting.

\subsection{Beyond Maximum}
There are ways of surpassing the maximum number of Power Points available to characters by using some of the supernatural powers described in the disciplines found in the following chapters.
