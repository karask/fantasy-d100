Fantasy D100 is a fantasy RPG game system. It is essentially my take of the great OpenQuest rules (based on the SRD version).

This has much more than my custom rules though. It has several additions and (what I believe are) cleaner mechanics that make use of character talents for any extraordinary abilities, including magic. At the same time it stays true to OQ's rational of being simple, flexible but still relatively realistic.

Fantasy D100 system is pretty open, both at character generation and during character advancement, in that they donâ€™t tie a character down to a predestined path of skill and talents. Everything is a potential choice that a Player can make during play.

Character generation produces characters that have skills in all the basic areas of expertise, a couple of speciality advanced skills, some talents (which incudes magic) and some skill in at least one or two weapons. Most Fantasy D100 characters start out being able to do most things, a skill area or two that they excel at, have a decent chance in a fight and have some talents to even out the odds.

Because Fantasy D100 characters start off more rounded there is less of an issue about getting the right mix of skills for the group so it can survive the adventure.
