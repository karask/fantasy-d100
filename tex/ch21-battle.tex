\chapter{Battle}
\label{ch:battle}

The Battle Discipline represents years of advanced traning in combat techniques. It enables warriors to reach an understanding of the flow of battle to such a degree that he can gain advantages over their opponents. Some times that is forcing an opponent to leave an opening or positioning themselves in such a way to avoid harm. Other times it enables unprecedented focus and calmness in the midst of battle enabling precise and calculated blows.


\section{Spot Rules}

\subsection{Learning Battle}
Characters learn Battle from other characters who know the practice. It costs two Improvement Points to get access to the Battle discipline. Each technique is learnt separately.

%With enough perseverance a character can practice and learn this Discipline by themselves but that will cost them double the Improvement Points normally required.

\subsection{Learning Techniques}
Characters learn Battle Techniques from other characters who know the appropriate techniques. Learning techniques costs one Improvement Point per Magnitude point. 
%If a character knows a technique at a lower Magnitude, they only have to pay the difference in Improvement Points to gain the technique at a higher Magnitude.

The maximum number of Battle Techniques a character can learn is INT/2.

\begin{rpg-examplebox}
Bors found a master that is willing to teach him Combat Mastery. He trains with him for some time and manages to learn the new technique (by spending three improvement points).
%Bors already knows Weapon Mastery at 1 Magnitude. He wants to learn Weapon Mastery 2, so he must spend only one Improvement Point to gain the technique at that Magnitude.
\end{rpg-examplebox}

Battle Techniques can be learnt from a number of sources. The most typical is from military academies but it can also be from the lone retired veteran. 

In each case the player character must be in good standing with the teacher before they will teach them a technique. If the teacher is indifferent to the player character to start with then they will first need to undertake some kind of service, which can be the focus of an adventure.

With enough perseverance a character can practice and learn new Battle Techniques by themselves but that will cost them double the Improvement Points normally required.

\subsection{Using Techniques}
A character can use a technique freely as part of a combat action or reaction. Only a single Battle Technique can be used per combat round. Any Battle Technique needs to be declared before the appropriate dice is rolled.

Applying a Battle Technique is always successful but you have to spend a number of Power Points equal to the Magnitude of the technique.


\subsection{Techniques Traits}
Unless otherwise stated all Techniques have the following traits.

\begin{rpg-list}
\item Are instant and apply only for the action or reaction that are rolled for.
\item Can not be used in combination with special attacks like Great Attack, Disarming Attack, Aim, etc.
\item Are Non-Variable; they can only be used at the specified Magnitude.
\end{rpg-list}

%Other traits used by techniques are detailed below. 
%\begin{description}
%	\item[Single-Attack:] Applies to a single attack.
%	\item[Combat Round:] Applies for the whole combat round (for that character)
%	\item[Non-Variable:] The technique may only be used at the stated Magnitude.
%\end{description}

\section{Techniques}
The battle techniques can improve various aspects of combat. Some are improved versions of existing manoeuvres, like Improved Disarm, while other are new, like Defensive Stance. These manoeuvres make more sense to acquire for combat experts since they will already have a high skill (which is harder to increase).
