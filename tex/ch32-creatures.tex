\chapter{Creatures}
\label{ch:creatures}

%\vspace{1em}

In Fantasy Crux, monsters can be as richly detailed as the characters themselves. As well as characteristics they have skills, weapons and supernatural abilities. They are not mere cannon fodder to be killed and looted. They have their own motives that often bring them into conflict with the player characters, and if sentient can be used to create player characters.

\vspace{1em}

This chapter contains several creatures grouped in lists according to their special characteristics; animals, spirits, undead, etc. It is encouraged (if not strongly recommended) that Game Masters create campaign-specific monsters using this section's material as examples.

\vspace{2em}

\begin{rpg-titlebox}{Monsters as Player Characters}
Although in theory many of the monsters in this chapter can be used as player characters the following are especially suited: Dwarf, Elf, Goblin, Orc, Lizardman. %Centaur, Ogre
\end{rpg-titlebox}
  
\vspace{2em}

The following characteristics, attributes, skills, and special rules, collectively known as a ‘Stat block’, for each of the creatures listed on the Monsters List, are the bare bones of a creature. You can use them straight away to give an average non-descript member of that race.

\vspace{1em}

To create creatures that truly fit the adage “Monsters are People too”, take the Stat block and use it as a base for a complete character. Think of a concept for the character and then add the skills, characteristics and supernatural abilities that the character needs. You may want to generate the creature character as if it was a player character. This often creates good opposition for the players, since the creature will be of comparable experience. 

\vspace{1em}

Note that you should be careful with increasing encounter difficulty by increasing numbers of monsters. A much better way is to increase the power of individual monsters, by increasing skills and supernatural abilities, to be closer to the player character power level.  Fantasy Crux combat works best when there is roughly the same amount of monsters as player characters.

\section{Animals}

This list describes more mundane animals. It lists domestic animals (such as horses and dogs), as well as wild beasts. Some of the animals are in their ‘Giant’ form, which are more threatening opponents than their normal species.

None of the animals listed here have any treasure by design. They may have some as determined by the Gamemaster as fits the needs of the story. For example a carnivore may have a few trinkets in the remains of its previous meals.

All the Animals listed here are of fixed INT and therefore not sentient. They have a Dodge, Persistence and Resilience of DEX x3, Pow x3, CON x3 respectively and none of them have any supernatural abilities.

		Any non-magical weapon hitting the basilisk corrodes in the creature’s blood, completely disintegrating after D4 rounds. The basilisk’s poison and corrosive blood are magical effects, which lose their special properties a few minutes after leaving the basilisk’s body, making it virtually impossible to use the creature as a source for making lethal compounds.
	\end{rpg-monsteraction}
	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[Death Gaze]
		A basilisk can kill with a glance. In combat the basilisk glares at a single opponent each round. If the basilisk overcomes the target in an opposed test of its Persistence against the target’s Resilience, the target dies instantly. Using the gaze attack costs no Power Points, and the basilisk may attack normally in any round in which it uses the gaze attack. This attack penetrates magical defences as if it were a Magnitude 6 Magic spell. If the target successfully resists the gaze attack, he is unharmed, though he may certainly be targeted again.

	\rpgmonstersection{Abilities}
	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[Attributes]
		The only Stat that an elemental has is SIZ, all its derived attributes and skills are based on this (see table~\ref{tab:elemental-attributes-skills}). Elementals attack by engulfing their enemies. All opponents within the area of attack are potential targets. Elementals use their Attack percentage, which is equal to their size times five, to hit the target who then resists using the resistance appropriate to the attack.
	\end{rpg-monsteraction}
	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[Immunities]
		Diseases, Poisons and their element.
	\end{rpg-monsteraction}
	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[See Invisible]
		Elementals have magical senses that allow them to ‘see’ invisible creatures, such as immaterial spirits. They also gain a +40\% when detecting hidden characters.
	\end{rpg-monsteraction}
	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[Camouflage]
		All elementals have the equivalent of a 80\% Deception when lying next to a environment of the same element as themselves. For example, undines are nearly invisible when lying in a pool of water and Gnomes can curl up and blend into a surrounding rocky area.

%		A Lamia is able to project an illusion that covers her lower half and makes her look like a human woman. The illusion only contains visual components – while it may look like the Lamia has legs, anyone brave enough to touch her will feel the hard, cold scales of her serpent half, rather than a pair of shapely legs. This illusion lasts as long as the Lamia wishes and costs her two Power Points per day to maintain. Her chance to create the illusion is 100\%. This illusion can be dispelled as though it were a Magnitude 4 spell.
%	\end{rpg-monsteraction}
%	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[Gaze Attack]
%		Each combat round, as a Combat Action, a Lamia may make a gaze attack to try to overcome a male humanoid (including humans, dwarfs, elfs, and orcs) in an opposed test of her Persistence against the male’s Resilience. This attack costs the Lamia no Power Points. If the Lamia wins, the man immediately falls hopelessly in love with her for as long as she is present. The first time he sees her in her true form, rather than cloaked in an illusion, he may attempt to break her hold by making another opposed test. If he succeeds, he breaks free, but if he fails, he remains entranced as long as he is in her presence. If a character is able to resist the Lamia’s gaze attack, he will be immune to it for a full 24 hours. The surest way to break someone of a Lamia’s influence is to remove him from her presence. Even then, the victim will remain in love with the Lamia for a number of days equal to her CHA. The Lamia uses this ability to keep a handful of strong warriors as her willing slaves and bodyguards for extended periods of time. Eventually, her gnawing hunger leads her to drain them of their blood, but such men may live for weeks or even months as a Lamia’s servant. A man in thrall to a Lamia will do virtually anything she asks, including attacking friends and comrades.
%	\end{rpg-monsteraction}
%	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[Blood Drain]
%		A Lamia loses 1D6 Hit Point per day to sustain her supernatural life, and does not regenerate Hit Points normally. Instead, she must take them from other beings by draining their blood. On a successful bite attack, the Lamia will hang on and drain one point of STR from the victim every round. Each point of drained STR gives the Lamia 1D6 Hit Points. When the Lamia drains the victim’s STR to 0, he dies. This attack costs the Lamia no Power Points.
%	\end{rpg-monsteraction}
%	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[POW Drain]
%		A Lamia’s kiss drains POW from the victim. When she kisses a victim, she must match her Persistence against the victim’s Persistence in a standard opposed test. If she succeeds, she drains 1D6 POW from the victim, granting her an equal number of Power Points. This POW loss is permanent for the victim, though the Lamia cannot drain a victim below POW 1. This attack costs the Lamia no Power Points.

A Slime’s attack may not be parried – the creature will simply slide around the parrying weapon to engulf its foe.

Every round a creature is enmeshed by a Slime, that creature will take acid damage equal to the SIZ of the Slime. Armour will protect against this damage for the first round, after which it is dissolved by the Slime’s acid, unless it is enchanted in some way or another. A character caught by a Slime may attempt to escape by making another Dodge or Athletics skill test.

		While in wolf form, werewolves are immune to most damage. Only magic, fire or weapons made of pure silver will harm them – all other blows simply bounce off harmlessly. If a normal sword with a Weapon Enhance 3 spell cast on it is used against a werewolf, only the three points of damage from the spell will affect the creature; the weapon’s normal damage, as well as the attacker’s Damage Modifier, do not count. The werewolf’s thick skin, which grants the beast one point of armour, would reduce the Weapon Enhance spell’s damage to two. If the entire weapon is enchanted, such as with a Fire Weapon spell, the entire damage rolled will count, though the wielder’s Damage Modifier will still be ignored. Werewolves can be poisoned, so long as the poison can be introduced to the creature’s body. They are living entities who require oxygen, and thus may be asphyxiated or drowned.

\section{Nymphs}
Nymphs are spirits embodying a particular place or natural feature. They take the form of humanoid women, though the precise details and powers vary according to the type of nymph.

Killing a nymph’s physical body sends her to the Spirit World.  The nymph, if unmolested in the Spirit World, will form a new body in her special place after 2D6 days, provided it remains intact.

Within a dryad’s grove is a particular tree she is mystically linked to; she will endure for as long as her personal tree endures, and no longer. A dryad can form or dissolve her body by stepping out of or into this tree, though if a dryad’s body is destroyed, it takes her time (as for any nymph) to form another.}\\

		If a fear spirit covertly possesses a host, the host becomes permanently Demoralised (as the Magic spell), until the spirit is cast out.
	\end{rpg-monsteraction}
	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[Madness Spirit]
		If a madness spirit succeeds in covertly possessing a victim, it will manifest itself in daily bouts of insanity. At least once per day, the madness spirit will attempt to cause an insane fit in its host. It matches its Persistence against the host’s Resilience in a standard opposed test. If the host succeeds, the madness spirit will be quiescent for at least a number of hours equal to the host’s POW. If the host fails, he becomes incapacitated for 1D20 hours – screaming madly, giggling incoherently or simply becoming catatonic for the duration of the effect. The madness spirit chooses the manner of madness, though most are partial to a single effect. The madness spirit will also attempt to assert itself whenever its host is in a stressful situation. Combat is an obvious example, but these spirits also delight in affecting their hosts in a variety of other stressful, important situations – collapsing into a fit of mad giggling while petitioning an unfriendly king for a boon is exactly the kind of thing madness spirits enjoy. Note that if the stressful situation occurs during a period of forced quiescence on the part of the spirit, it will be unable to manifest itself.
	\end{rpg-monsteraction}
	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[Pain Spirit]
		If a pain spirit manages to covertly possess its target, the victim will be overcome with a sudden burst of pain. From that point on, until the spirit is cast out, the victim will always be conscious of a dull ache in his joints or a twinge in his muscles. Whenever the host acts quickly (as in combat) or concentrates (as in spell casting), and sometimes purely at random intervals, he is struck by a sudden spasm of pain. This pain reduces all the host’s skill tests by a penalty equal to the spirit’s POW.

	\end{rpg-monsteraction}
	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[Power Point drain]
                A vampire does not regenerate Hit Points or Power Points normally. Instead, he must take them from other beings by draining their blood. On a successful bite attack, the vampire will hang on and drain D6 Power Points from the victim every round. Each drained Power Point gives the vampire one Hit Point or Power Point (vampire’s choice). When the Vampire drains the victim’s Power Points to 0, the victim fails unconscious, as normal, and the vampire can choose to carry on draining blood, except now it’s the victim’s permanent POW that is drained.
	\end{rpg-monsteraction}
	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[Shapeshifting]
		Vampires have the ability to shapeshift into mist at will. As a single Combat Action, the vampire (and every non-living item on his person) dissolves into a thin, greenish fog approximately the same SIZ as he was in the flesh. As a mist, the vampire is immune to all types of physical damage, but cannot take any action except Movement Rate. In mist form, a vampire moves at the same speed as he would normally and is unaffected by strong winds. Additionally, vampires still take damage from sunlight, as normal.
		As well as the ability to transform into mist, some vampires manifest the ability to shapeshift into wolves and bats as well. As with the mist transformation, such changes take a Combat Action to perform.
		Upon death, the vampire collapses to the ground and turns to mist at the beginning of the next Combat Round. Before then, it can be destroyed permanently by driving a stake through its heart (the only way to prevent it turning to mist) and decapitating it.
	\end{rpg-monsteraction}
	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[Sunlight Weakness]
		As creatures of the night Vampires cannot stand the touch of natural sunlight. They take two point of damage per round that they are exposed to the sun, though some will risk travelling in the daylight hours by wearing layers of clothing and a hood to cover as much of their body as possible.
	\end{rpg-monsteraction}
	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[Holy Symbols]
		In the past the holy icons of some religions have proved effective against vampires. Those that focus their energies against the undead are the most likely to be effective. But it is down to the Gamemaster to decide what supernaturally offends any particular vampire.  An elven vampire, for example, might be repelled by symbols of nature gods, rather than by human symbols of holiness. Any character presenting a holy symbol to a vampire as a Combat Action matches their Persistence against the vampire’s Resilience in an opposed check. They will receive bonuses or penalties at the Gamemaster’s discretion, based on the appropriateness of the symbol being displayed. On a successful test, the vampire loses 1D4 Hit Points (unaffected by armour or any of the vampire’s magic) and may not attack that character or any other character under the protection of Holy Symbol.
