\chapter{Creatures}
\label{ch:creatures}

In Fantasy D100, monsters can be as richly detailed as the characters themselves. As well as characteristics they have skills, weapons and supernatural abilities. They are not mere cannon fodder to be killed and looted. They have their own motives that often bring them into conflict with the player characters, and if sentient can be used to create player characters.

This chapter is split into two lists. The first is the Monster List, which is full of creatures fantastic and magical. The second is the Animals List, a smaller list which details more mundane creatures, which the characters may encounter or commonly use as mounts and beasts of burden. Note that just only a sample of the most characteristic monsters are described here. Game masters should consult other D100 supplements (e.g. from Open Quest) to get more ready-made monsters. It is encouraged that Game Masters create campaign-specific monsters using this section's material as examples.

\begin{rpg-titlebox}{Monsters as Player Characters}
Although in theory many of the monsters in this chapter can be used as player characters the following are especially suited: Dwarf, Elf, Centaur, Goblin, Orc, Ogre, Lizard Man.
\end{rpg-titlebox}
  
The following characteristics, attributes, skills, and special rules, collectively known as a ‘Stat block’, for each of the creatures listed on the Monsters List, are the bare bones of a creature. You can use them straight away to give an average non-descript member of that race.

To create creatures that truly fit the adage “Monsters are People too”, take the Stat block and use it as a base for a complete character. Think of a concept for the character and then add the skills, characteristics and supernatural abilities that the character needs. You may want to generate the creature character as if it was a player character. This often creates good opposition for the players, since the creature will be of comparable experience. 

Note that you should be careful with increasing encounter difficulty by increasing numbers of monsters. A much better way is to increase the power of individual monsters, by increasing skills and supernatural abilities, to be closer to the player character power level.  Fantasy D100 combat works best when there is roughly the same amount of monsters as player characters.

\section{Animals}

This list describes more mundane animals. It lists domestic animals (such as horses and dogs), as well as wild beasts. Some of the animals are in their ‘Giant’ form, which are more threatening opponents than their normal species.

None of the animals listed here have any treasure by design. They may have some as determined by the Games Master as fits the needs of the story. For example a carnivore may have a few trinkets In the remains of its previous meals.

All the Animals listed here are of fixed INT and therefore not sentient. They have a Dodge, Persistence and Resilience of DEX x3, Pow x3, CON x3 respectively and none of them know have any supernatural abilities.

		Any non-magical weapon hitting the basilisk corrodes in the creature’s blood, completely disintegrating after D4 rounds. The basilisk’s poison and corrosive blood are magical effects, which lose their special properties a few minutes after leaving the basilisk’s body, making it virtually impossible to use the creature as a source for making lethal compounds.
	\end{rpg-monsteraction}
	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[Death Gaze]
		A basilisk can kill with a glance. In combat the basilisk glares at a single opponent each round. If the basilisk overcomes the target in an opposed test of its Persistence against the target’s Resilience, the target dies instantly. Using the gaze attack costs no Power Points, and the basilisk may attack normally in any round in which it uses the gaze attack. This attack penetrates magical defences as if it were a Magnitude 6 Magic spell. If the target successfully resists the gaze attack, he is unharmed, though he may certainly be targeted again.

		The only Stat that an elemental has is SIZ, all its derived attributes and skills are based on this (see table~\ref{tab:elemental-attributes-skills}). Elementals attack by engulfing their enemies. All opponents within the area of attack are potential targets. Elementals use their Attack percentage, which is equal to their size times five, to hit the target who then resists using the resistance appropriate to the attack.

		Diseases and Poisons

	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[Camouflage]
		All elementals have the equivalent of a 80\% Deception when lying next to a environment of the same element as themselves. For example, undines are nearly invisible when lying in a pool of water and Gnomes can curl up and blend into a surrounding rocky area.

	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[Madness Spirit]
		If a madness spirit succeeds in covertly possessing a victim, it will manifest itself in daily bouts of insanity. At least once per day, the madness spirit will attempt to cause an insane fit in its host. It matches its Persistence against the host’s Resilience in a standard opposed test. If the host succeeds, the madness spirit will be quiescent for at least a number of hours equal to the host’s POW. If the host fails, he becomes incapacitated for 1D20 hours – screaming madly, giggling incoherently or simply becoming catatonic for the duration of the effect. The madness spirit chooses the manner of madness, though most are partial to a single effect. The madness spirit will also attempt to assert itself whenever its host is in a stressful situation. Combat is an obvious example, but these spirits also delight in affecting their hosts in a variety of other stressful, important situations – collapsing into a fit of mad giggling while petitioning an unfriendly king for a boon is exactly the kind of thing madness spirits enjoy. Note that if the stressful situation occurs during a period of forced quiescence on the part of the spirit, it will be unable to manifest itself.
	\end{rpg-monsteraction}
	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[Pain Spirit]
		If a pain spirit manages to covertly possess its target, the victim will be overcome with a sudden burst of pain. From that point on, until the spirit is cast out, the victim will always be conscious of a dull ache in his joints or a twinge in his muscles. Whenever the host acts quickly (as in combat) or concentrates (as in spell casting), and sometimes purely at random intervals, he is struck by a sudden spasm of pain. This pain reduces all the host’s skill tests by a penalty equal to the spirit’s POW.

	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[Ghoul Howl]
		Ghouls can employ a blood chilling howl once per combat round in addition to a Claw or Bite attack. When a ghoul howls, every creature in a radius equal to the ghoul’s POW in metres becomes Demoralised (as the Magic spell), unless he can overcome the ghoul’s Persistence with his Resilience in an opposed test. The Demoralise effect continues until all howling stops. Any who are able to resist the howling must resist again every round for a total of five successive rounds, after which they are considered immune to the howling’s effects for a week. Countermagic, Shield and Spell Resistance offer no protection against the effects of a ghoul’s howl.

		Vampires can see in the dark and at night as if it was day by sensing life energy.
	\end{rpg-monsteraction}
	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[Power Point drain]
                A vampire does not regenerate Hit Points or Power Points normally. Instead, he must take them from other beings by draining their blood. On a successful bite attack, the vampire will hang on and drain D6 Power Points from the victim every round. Each drained Power Point gives the vampire one Hit Point or Power Point (vampire’s choice). When the Vampire drains the victim’s Power Points to 0, the victim fails unconscious, as normal, and the vampire can choose to carry on draining blood, except now it’s the victim’s permanent POW that is drained.
	\end{rpg-monsteraction}
	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[Shapeshifting]
		Vampires have the ability to shapeshift into mist at will. As a single Combat Action, the vampire (and every non-living item on his person) dissolves into a thin, greenish fog approximately the same SIZ as he was in the flesh. As a mist, the vampire is immune to all types of physical damage, but cannot take any action except Movement Rate. In mist form, a vampire moves at the same speed as he would normally and is unaffected by strong winds. Additionally, vampires still take damage from sunlight, as normal.
		As well as the ability to transform into mist, some vampires manifest the ability to shapeshift into wolves and bats as well. As with the mist transformation, such changes take a Combat Action to perform.
		Upon death, the vampire collapses to the ground and turns to mist at the beginning of the next Combat Round. Before then, it can be destroyed permanently by driving a stake through its heart (the only way to prevent it turning to mist) and decapitating it.
	\end{rpg-monsteraction}
	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[Sunlight Weakness]
		As creatures of the night Vampires cannot stand the touch of natural sunlight. They take two point of damage per round that they are exposed to the sun, though some will risk travelling in the daylight hours by wearing layers of clothing and a hood to cover as much of their body as possible.
	\end{rpg-monsteraction}
	\begin{rpg-monsteraction}[Holy Symbols]
		In the past the holy icons of some religions have proved effective against vampires. Those that focus their energies against the undead are the most likely to be effective. But it is down to the Games Master to decide what supernaturally offends any particular vampire.  An elven vampire, for example, might be repelled by symbols of nature gods, rather than by human symbols of holiness. Any character presenting a holy symbol to a vampire as a Combat Action matches their Persistence against the vampire’s Resilience in an opposed check. They will receive bonuses or penalties at the Games Master’s discretion, based on the appropriateness of the symbol being displayed. On a successful test, the vampire loses 1D4 Hit Points (unaffected by armour or any of the vampire’s magic) and may not attack that character or any other character under the protection of Holy Symbol.
