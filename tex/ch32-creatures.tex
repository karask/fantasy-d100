\chapter{Creatures}
\label{ch:creatures}

In Fantasy D100, monsters can be as richly detailed as the characters themselves. As well as characteristics they have skills, weapons and supernatural abilities. They are not mere cannon fodder to be killed and looted. They have their own motives that often bring them into conflict with the player characters, and if sentient can be used to create player characters.

This chapter is split into two lists. The first is the Monster List, which is full of creatures fantastic and magical. The second is the Animals List, a smaller list which details more mundane creatures, which the characters may encounter or commonly use as mounts and beasts of burden. Note that just only a sample of the most characteristic monsters are described here. Game masters should consult other D100 supplements (e.g. from Open Quest) to get more ready-made monsters. It is encouraged that Game Masters create campaign-specific monsters using this section's material as examples.

\begin{rpg-titlebox}{Monsters as Player Characters}
Although in theory many of the monsters in this chapter can be used as player characters the following are especially suited: Dwarf, Elf, Centaur, Goblin, Orc, Ogre, Lizard Man.
\end{rpg-titlebox}
  
The following characteristics, attributes, skills, and special rules, collectively known as a ‘Stat block’, for each of the creatures listed on the Monsters List, are the bare bones of a creature. You can use them straight away to give an average non-descript member of that race.

To create creatures that truly fit the adage “Monsters are People too”, take the Stat block and use it as a base for a complete character. Think of a concept for the character and then add the skills, characteristics and supernatural abilities that the character needs. You may want to generate the creature character as if it was a player character. This often creates good opposition for the players, since the creature will be of comparable experience. 

Note that you should be careful with increasing encounter difficulty by increasing numbers of monsters. A much better way is to increase the power of individual monsters, by increasing skills and supernatural abilities, to be closer to the player character power level.  Fantasy D100 combat works best when there is roughly the same amount of monsters as player characters.
