\chapter{Plunder}
\label{ch:plunder}

Although Fantasy D100 is not a game of ‘Killing Things and Taking their Stuff’, it is sometimes useful and expected that creatures that the Player Characters meet upon their Quests will have treasure, both mundane and magical.


\section{Plunder Factor}

Normally the needs of the story can dictate what treasure and supernatural items a creature possesses, but if a quick random roll is necessary the following guidelines can be consulted.

Each creature has a ‘Plunder Factor’ which is a rating of how much treasure the creature is likely to be carrying. For creatures that form groups, increase the Plunder Factor by at least one, for groups of up to 20 creatures, by two for larger groups of up to a hundred creatures, and by 3 for groups of over a hundred. In this case the Plunder will be held in a defended and guarded treasure room which the leader of the creatures will have access to.

The following table has a list of potential treasure for creatures depending on their Plunder Factor. If applicable (e.g. campaign has supernatural Disciplines, like magic) also roll for the supernatural items.

        \textbf{Plunder Factor}  & \textbf{Treasure Found}\\
        \hline
	0 & Not a hoarder. No treasure whatsoever.\\
        1 & Chance hoarder. A couple of coppers, loose change (1D6 CP). Very remote (05\%) chance of a supernatural item, which is either used by accident (my lucky talisman) or which the creature is completely oblivious to.\\
	2 & Hoards enough for a rainy day. About 5D20 in SP, 1D10 GD. If the creature has supernatural abilities, there is a POW \% chance of 1D4 Minor supernatural items appropriate to the type.\\
	3 & Hoards for a better future. Collects treasure for its worth and appreciates its value. 5D100 in SP, 3D20 in GD. If the creature has supernatural abilities, there is a POW X 2\% chance of 1D4 appropriate Minor supernatural items.\\
	4 & Significant hoard. Hoards for hoarding’s sake. 10D100 SP, 1D100 GD. POW X 3\% of 1D6 Minor supernatural items and POW \% chance of 1D4 Major supernatural items.\\
	5 & Treasure trove. The wealth of a minor Lord. Examples: Grave goods of a dead noble worth about 1D6 thousand Silver Pieces, with 1D6 Minor supernatural Items and POW X 3\% chance of 1D6 Major supernatural Items.\\
	6 & Wealth of Kings. eg. Dragon’s Hoard, a hoard almost beyond comprehension 1D4 Million Silver pieces, 2D10 Minor, 1D8 Major and one unique supernatural item.\\
