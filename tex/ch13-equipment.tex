\chapter{Equipment}
\label{ch:equipment}

Fantasy roleplaying games can be thought of as a form of cooperative improvised theatre. You could think of the players as the actors and the Games Master as the director and production team providing the stage and scenery, a huge big budget supporting cast and every prop that the actors could possibly need. This chapter deals with the props, the equipment that the player characters will be using.

\section{In-game Economics}
These rules do not give detailed rules for trading and fantasy world economics.  Although dry economic markets are unlikely to feature heavily in adventure stories, the exploits of daring and wily merchant adventurers are. The following section outlines how to approach such stories using Fantasy D100.

\subsection{Merchant based Games}
Some players will feel inclined to create colourful and flamboyant Merchant characters and weave stories around their trade missions to far off unexplored countries creating drama and tension on their trade negotiations and deals. This is great and is to be encouraged. Opposed Trade tests can be used to handle the outcome of such action where it is less than clear cut, and the ebb and flow of the character’s finances acts as an indicator of success (see the Trade skill description on p39). The more martially and magically inclined characters can provide support and have their moments in the spotlight too on these mercantile adventures, taking on the villains hired by their rivals in commerce. If you are in need of inspiration then you only have to look to the real life historical adventures of Marco Polo.

Merchant characters also make great information gatherers, since they tend to have good social skills. Often this goes on under the cover of trading in the market, gathering gossip from the locals, or sorting out a new trade deal with a noble family, which is a legitimate way of finding information about a noble.

\subsubsection{Availability of Goods}
The equipment lists serve as ‘game tools’ to allow players to quickly and easily buy equipment for their characters. The range of goods listed at the quoted prices is only going to be available in a large metropolis with organised markets and districts given over to shops and mercantile activity. 

In less prosperous cities and towns there is a smaller range available, sometimes at higher costs. In rural areas, only local produce and a small amount of locally crafted goods can be bought at a reasonable price. There might be oddities to this model and these can lead to further adventure. 

\begin{rpg-examplebox}
A village without an armourer has a large cache of old armour and weapons for sale at a good price. This is because a local monster living in a nearby cave has been ambushing and killing adventurers for years and then trading their equipment to the villagers. In turn, the villagers oblige by sending a steady stream of fresh and inexperienced adventurers, such as the recently arrived player characters, to its lair.
\end{rpg-examplebox}

\subsubsection{Barter}
Coins are the main exchange method for the landed nobility and rich merchants. Barter is the main method of exchanging goods for people outside of the main urban areas. In such transactions successful Opposed Test using the Trade of the buyer versus the Trade of the seller are needed for the buyer to get the best deal.

\subsubsection{Consequences}
The main thing to remember is that with any item of equipment there are consequences in their use as well as benefits. The most obvious consequence is encumbrance. A heavily armoured and equipped character will be slowed, unable to use skills as effectively and will become fatigued more easily.

A less obvious effect is that an obviously well equipped character becomes a target for both minor and major theft. From the opportunistic thief who desires the player’s new sword to the more organised bandit group who targets the party because they believe that they have a stash of treasure back at their base because of all the flashy new equipment they are wearing.

There might also be social consequences. In civilised towns and cities, prominent displays of arms and armour may unsettle and upset the locals and bring about the unwanted attention of the Watch who want to make sure that the characters are not violent troublemakers. In some more draconian fantasy lands there may even be laws and social codes that dictate what arms and armour a citizen may own and in what situations they may carry it. 

\subsubsection{Currency}
Coins are usually created in ‘mints’ tightly controlled by the local nobility,  appointed by the local ruler, whose head appears on one side of the coin. Other sources of coin are usually the treasure troves of monsters, whose assets are brought into the economy by enterprising adventurers.

Currency can be based upon whatever is valued by the culture using it.  Being a fantasy game, many variant systems of currency can be created. For example, a system that uses the teeth of slain dragons or magical gemstones enchanted with minor magic that is useful in everyday life can be used as an exchange mechanism.

For ease of use here’s a simple coin based currency that will be used throughout the rest of this book to give value to an item.

\begin{rpg-table}[|X|]
	\hline
        5 Lead Bits (LB) = 1 Copper Penny (CP)\\
	10 Copper Pennies (CP) = 1 Silver Piece (SP)\\
	20 Silver Pieces (SP) = 1 gold ducat (GD)\\
	\hline
\end{rpg-table}

\section{The Equipment Lists}
The rest of this chapter is given over to equipment lists. These lists provide the cost of the item and details any game effects.  They also where appropriate give an Encumbrance value (ENC) for the item in question. This is a value which rates both the weight and how physically unwieldy an item is. This is for the `Encumbrance' rules given in page~\pageref{ssec:encumbrance}.

\section{Close Combat Weapons}
All Close Combat weapons use the Close Combat skill.  Each close combat weapon is characterised by the following qualities: 

\begin{description}
	\item[Type:] This shows how the weapon is wielded and other special rules (see `Close Combat Weapon Types' below).
	\item[Damage Dice:] The damage the weapon deals on a successful attack. 
	\item[STR/DEX:] The minimum STR and DEX scores needed to easily wield this weapon. If either of the Characteristics are below these minimums, a –20\% maximum penalty is applied to a character’s skill when attacking and parrying with this weapon. 
	\item[ENC:] The weapon’s Encumbrance. The weight and bulk of the weapon. 
	\item[Size:] Weapons are rated in the following size categories: Light, Medium, Heavy and Huge. Weapons need to be of the same category or larger to block all damage. If the defending weapon is one category less they block half damage. If two categories less they cannot block the damage.
	\item[Cost:] The cost in silver pieces to purchase this weapon.

\subsubsection{Close Combat Weapon Types}
\label{sssec:close-combat-weapon-types}
\begin{description}
	\item[1H:] This weapon must be used one-handed.
	\item[2H:] This weapon must be used two-handed.
	\item[Flex:] This weapon can be used two-handed.  When used in two hands, it gains +1 damage and can be used by someone with a STR 2 less than that listed.
	\item[Set:] This weapon may be set against a charge. 
	\item[Range:] This weapon suffers no penalty when thrown. 
	\item[LS:]  This weapon may be used as a Longspear.  If used as a Longspear it may be set against charges.  The wielder must state, however, at the start of combat how it is being wielded and must take a ‘Change stance’ action to alter its usage. 
\end{description}

Note that improvised and primitive weapons: such as a stone hatchet, stone spear or a convenient log picked up and used as a club, do the same damage as the base weapon -1.

\section{Ranged Weapons}
Each ranged weapon is characterised by the following qualities:
\begin{description}
	\item[Type:] This shows how the weapon is wielded and other special rules (see `Weapon Types' in page~\pageref{}).
	\item[Damage Dice:] The damage the weapon deals on a successful attack. 
	\item[Range:] This is the effective range of the weapon.  A target within the weapon’s range may be attacked without penalty. A target within double the weapon’s range may be attacked, but the attacker’s effective Weapon skill is halved (before other modifiers are applied). Attacks against targets beyond double the weapon’s range automatically fail.
	\item[STR/DEX:] The minimum STR and DEX scores needed to easily wield this weapon. If either of the Characteristics are below these minimums, a maximum –20\% penalty is applied to a character’s skill when attacking and parrying with this weapon.
	\item[ENC:] The weapon’s Encumbrance. The weight and bulk of the weapon. 
	\item[Cost:] The cost in silver pieces to purchase this weapon.

\subsubsection{Effects of SIZ ono Armor}
Armour made for a character of SIZ 1 to 5 will have its cost and ENC halved from that shown on table~\ref{tab:armors}. Characters of SIZ 21 or higher will double the cost and ENC for armour made for them.

Also note that:
\begin{rpg-list}
	\item Characters may try using plate armour not designed for them but the ENC will be doubled. 
	\item Characters may not wear more than one type of armour, i.e. layer armour, to get increased Armour Points.
