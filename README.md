# Introduction

This is an RPG game system for classic fantasy games. It is essentially my take of the great OpenQuest rules (based on the SRD version).

This has much more than my custom rules though. It has several additions and (what I believe are) cleaner mechanics that make use of character talents for any extraordinary abilities, including magic. At the same time it stays true to OQ's rational of being simple, flexible but still relatively realistic.

I used Krozark's great template for the latex layout: https://github.com/Krozark/RPG-LaTeX-Template.git.
