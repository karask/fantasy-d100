In folder fantasy-d100 there is my ttrpg written in latex. I want you to consult the tex files in fantasy-d100/tex and create a summary of those rules. I want only chapters 1-8. All the rules of those chapters but make them as concise as possible (for example the rules on parrying with a weapon or shield depending on thrown weapons of range weapons are described in more than one place). Also shorten the introductory stuff and explanation throughout. So as short as possible but "leave no rule behind".

I also want the new document to be as presentable as possible. I would like you to use typst with the owlbear template which is specific for rpgs. When you create tables or reuse images from the original short make sure you use the appropriate owlbear syntax/notation for an eye pleasing result. Create a single typst file for simplicity (unlike the tex files which are one per chapter).
