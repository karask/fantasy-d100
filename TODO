Priority
- calculate 'Armor Encumbrance'??
  - Combat Order: deduct Armor's ENC divided by 2 ! (maybe not because of Magic spells diminishing the uniqueness of armor ??
  - Running / Swimming / Climbing ?? (Leather: None, Ringmail/Scalemail: -20 and Chainmail/Platemail -40 for consistency) -- implicit by GM or explicit in the rules? -- just mention somewhere?

- add Combat Order in character sheet

- add Demons !! (and angel ?)

- Add Mage (76-99) and Archmage (100+) (instead of Magus) in Arcane Magic?

- create monster template !?! (for manually writing stuff)
- create character sheet  (contain space for companions like familiar/fetch/dog/horse/etc)
- create NPC sheet 

- CONSIDER OQ v3 changes
  . https://openquestrpg.com/2020/09/14/openquest-2nd-to-3rd-edition-change-log/
    . AS MANY REACTIONS AS YOU WANT but at -20 every time... ????

- CONSIDER Legend
  . ongoing
  . MAYBE ADD Legend's combat manuevers as weapon 'types' like Flex, 2H, etc. ???
  . MAYBE change weapons and their damages from Legend ?? -- SIMPLER, CRITICAL allows for 2 combat manuevers: Maximum Damage, Ignore Armor, AND add as many manuevers make sense !! (add critical defense manuevers !!)
    . OR just give some bonus to critical defense...?

Future?
- Integrate all Combat Actions and calculate how many each character can do (consule Legends)

- Add AI generated images !!
